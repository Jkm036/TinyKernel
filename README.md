# TinyKernel 
This is a passion project that I am tryign to find time for. This ismy first attempt at kernel developement to any extent and it's something that I'm doing because I <br>
because of my passiont for lower level learning. I plan to update the read me as a progress throughtout the project and document what I've learned and the different tools <br> used during my journey.
I am following a tuturial authored by Daneil McCarthy. You can access then same tutorial on udemy at: https://www.udemy.com/course/developing-a-multithreaded-kernel-from-scratch/learn/lecture/23972412#overview <br>
