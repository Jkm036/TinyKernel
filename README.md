# TinyKernel 
This is a passion project that I am trying to find time for. This is my first attempt at kernel developement to any extent and it's something that I'm doing
because of my passion for lower level learning. I plan to update the readme as I progress throughout the project and document what I've learned and the different tools used during my journey.
I am following a tuturial authored by Daneil McCarthy. You can access then same tutorial on udemy at: https://www.udemy.com/course/developing-a-multithreaded-kernel-from-scratch/learn/lecture/23972412#overview <br>
